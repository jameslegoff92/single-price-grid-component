## My process

1. I begin by analyzing both the mobile and desktop design to see how my HTML markup needs to be structured.
2. The next step would consist of seeing if any design patterns are repeated. If so, my css classes need to take these design patterns into consideration.
3. Begin coding using the mobile first approach.
4. End by refactoring my code.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM Methodology
- Sass
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
