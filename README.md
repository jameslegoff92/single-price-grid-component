## My process

1. I begin by analyzing both the mobile and desktop design to see how my HTML markup needs to be structured.
3. The next step would consist of seeing if any design patterns are repeated. If so, my css classes need to take these design patterns into consideration.
4. Begin coding using the mobile first approach.
5. End by refactoring my code.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM Methodology
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Estimated time to complete project: 2.5 hours.
Actual time to complete project: 2 hours, 23mins, 31 secs.
Time spent refactoring: 14mins, 46secs.

The challenge was pretty straight forward, however there were a few moments that slowed down the coding process. Those were. . . 

  1. Getting the svg to move to the right of the div.
  2. Converting the mobile column design into the desktop design.
  3. Getting the font-color to match.
  4. Finding the right values for the box-shadow effect.

This project taught me effective ways to solve 1,3 and 4. For #2, I learned the difference between thinking of a solution to a problem, and applying it. The imagined solution doesn't always go as smoothly as one hopes haha.
